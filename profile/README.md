Read on for a breakdown of exactly how to earn $750 in gift cards for Shein, Amazon or other popular retailers, or even Visa gift cards or money deposited directly into your Cash App or PayPal account. Keep in mind that, although Flash Rewards earned a 4-star rating on TrustPilot, there may be easier and faster ways to earn money online.

Quick Take: Is Cash App Really Giving Away Money?
=
The truth is, the $750 Cash App reward through Flash Rewards’ partner site Rewards Giant USA is not a scam. It’s a legitimate program to earn extra money in your spare time. However, earning cash through Flash Rewards is not as easy as you might think it is. Here are some key takeaways

The Flash Rewards Web app allows you to earn rewards by completing certain activities called deals. It’s owned by Deliver Technology LLC, which also own Rewards Giant USA. 
The smartphone app also offers gift cards in exchange for coins you earn, but instead of completing surveys, you play games on your phone. The app earned 4.5 stars in the Google Play store.
The $750 Flash Rewards is legitimate, but it may not be easy, and you will need to spend some money to reach that level of earning.
Cash App is not giving away $750, but Flash Rewards gives people a chance to earn up to $750 in gift card rewards or Cash App or PayPal deposits by completing tasks online. These tasks include watching videos, taking surveys and also making specific purchases.
If you want to earn money through Cash App, consider referring friends using your Cash App referral code. You will both receive bonus cash after your friend links a debit card and sends $5 to someone within two weeks.

What Is the $750 Flash Reward?
=
After you’ve signed up, you’ll complete various Deals. To earn $750, you’ll need to complete 20 Deals at various levels, including 10 Deals at Level 5. You could potentially increase your earnings to $1,000 by completing 15 Deals at Level 5. Keep in mind, all your Deals must be completed within 60 days, so you won’t want to stall once you create an account with the web app.

Finally, once you’ve completed Deals to claim your earnings, you will need to submit your photo ID and a selfie online. For some people, this is a drawback to the app, since they might be concerned about security. But with such high-value rewards at stake, it is understandable why Flash Rewards would require such steps.

How To Get Free Money Through Flash Rewards
=
When you first sign up for Flash Rewards, you’ll be prompted to answer a few questions. These questions relate to your interests and activities. They may be used to determine the surveys and deals you receive, but not your eligibility. So don’t think too hard about how you might answer.

Many of the higher level Deals require purchases or subscriptions. That’s fine, if it’s a service you would use anyway. But if you wouldn’t, you may want to consider other ways to earn cash back online or through your phone.

Reviews About Flash Rewards
=
The rewards on TrustPilot might make you wary of trying the Flash Rewards app. Most of the reviews on the site are positive, but 16% of them come from users who gave the app one star.



Reviewers mention waiting weeks or months to receive a reward smaller than they expected. Others claimed they were banned from the site just before completing the deals to earn a reward. Most negative reviews mention the time commitment as a downside. However, Flash Rewards was quick to respond to the negative reviews with suggested solutions.

Make Your Money Work Better for You
=
Many other 5-star reviewers noted that they received rewards of $100, $250 instead of the promised $750 Cash App reward that is advertised on so many apps. This suggests that earning the full $750 may be harder than you realize.

If you decide to use Flash Rewards, make sure to document that you completed all the Deals by taking screenshots. You may have to email customer support with proof you completed Deals in order to collect your money.


Also, make sure to keep track of any subscriptions you purchase so you can cancel if you decide you don’t want them. Don’t cancel before you’ve earned your rewards, though, or you might be disqualified.

Can You Get Rewards from Cash App?

There are other ways to earn free money on Cash App, too. One of the easiest ways to earn money through Cash App is to sell used or new items through Facebook marketplace and request that buyers pay using Cash App.

You can also earn a referral bonus when you share your link for your friends to start using Cash App. You can also save money by using your Cash Card* when shopping with select merchants.


Better Ways To Earn Money Through Apps

Fortunately, even if you decide to steer clear of Flash Rewards, you can still earn money and gift cards online. Most of the apps spotlighted below do not require you to buy anything specific beyond what you would normally buy. For instance, if you are booking a trip, you can book through Expedia and earn cash back through Rakuten. But you don’t have to subscribe to a survey or download an app you don’t need or want just to earn free money.

Other Cash Back Apps That Let You Make Money
Completing surveys and signing up for deals are not the only ways to earn money through apps. If you’re willing to download a cash back app or browser extension or want to complete quick surveys in your spare time, you can earn a few extra bucks on your phone. 


Cash-back shopping apps like Rakuten and Ibotta let you earn money for shopping you would normally do anyway. They also offer bonuses to boost your earnings.

Rakuten

One of the leaders in cash-back shopping apps, Rakuten offers cash back when you shop online or in stores. When you’re shopping online, you’ll want to download the browser extension. You’ll see a small purple button pop up whenever a website is partnered with Rakuten to pay cash back.

If you’re shopping in the stores, you can link specific debit or credit cards to the Rakuten app. Then, pay in stores that offer Rakuten rewards using that card.

You can also earn $30 by referring a friend to Rakuten. Money is deposited quarterly into your PayPal account, or you can choose to receive gift cards from top retailers, instead. You’ll need more than $5 in rewards to earn what Rakuten calls your “Big Fat Check.”


Ibotta

Ibotta is another highly reputable cash-back app that you can use while shopping in stores and online. If you are new to the app, you might be able to receive a welcome bonus. The bonus is seasonal, so the offer changes throughout the year. For example, the fall sign up bonus is a free Thanksgiving dinner.

With Ibotta, you’ll need to activate offers before you shop. You can also download the Ibotta web browser to claim offers when you visit your favorite e-commerce websites. Ibotta allows you to withdraw cash directly into your back account, as long as it is linked to your Ibotta account.

You can earn $10 when you refer friends to Ibotta. Rewards for referring friends can change at any time, so check the website for the most current offer.


Online Survey Sites
Many people take online surveys to make money. There are many websites that allow you to take surveys online, but not many that are worth your time. Review these sites carefully before you sign up.

Survey Junkie
Survey Junkie allows you to earn money, if you qualify. You can cash out when you earn as little as $5. The app is honest and realistic about earnings. If you complete three surveys per day, you have the potential to earn $40 per month.

Swagbucks
Swagbucks is another app that allows you to earn money when you take surveys. You can also earn Swagbucks, which can be converted to gift cards or cash deposited in your PayPal account when you shop online.


Final Take To GO: How Do I Claim My $750 Cash App?
The $750 Cash App reward isn’t a scam, but it’s not the easiest way to earn money online, either. It can take up to 60 days to qualify for the rewards, and you’ll have to complete a fairly complex verification process to claim your prize. The time and energy you put into earning the gift card may not be worth it in the end. Consider more reputable apps like Rakuten, which are also easier to use.
